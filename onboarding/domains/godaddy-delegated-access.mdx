## What is Delegated Access?

Delegated Access allows you to invite WRLD (or any web designer/developer) to access your GoDaddy products without sharing your password. Delegates can manage your domains and hosting but **cannot** view or change sensitive account information like payment methods or passwords.

## How to Invite WRLD as a Delegate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Delegate Access">
    Visit your GoDaddy [Delegate Access](https://account.godaddy.com/access) page. You may be prompted to sign in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Invite to Access">
    In the **People who can access my account** section, click **Invite to Access**.

    ![Select Invite to Access](https://images.ctfassets.net/7y9uzj0z4srt/1J6s4shIJSN3ocNFc8txId/a4687439d2367902de0aade501d5ff81/mya-select-invite-to-access-02.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Contact Information">
    Enter the **Name** and **Email** for the person you're inviting.

    For WRLD, use:
    - **Name**: Ridge Lawrence (or WRLD Tech)
    - **Email**: `ridge@wrld.tech`

    ![Enter Name and Email](https://images.ctfassets.net/7y9uzj0z4srt/333unDU9hGtYuOg4vnuxy0/06aa6cba7365a77f228cecef5504dce5/mya-enter-name-email-03.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Access Level">
    Choose the appropriate access level. For most domain management tasks, **Products, Domains & Purchase** is sufficient.

    Not sure? See GoDaddy's [explanation of access levels](https://www.godaddy.com/help/delegate-access-levels-of-permission-12374).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the Invitation">
    Click **Invite**. GoDaddy will send an email invitation. Once the delegate accepts, you'll be notified.
