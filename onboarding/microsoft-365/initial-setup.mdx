## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Company Email (Log in using a work or school account)
- Temporary Password Provided by Manager/IT
- Microsoft Authenticator App on Mobile
- Access to Private Network Internet
- (If Bring Your Own Device) Must Be Local Administrator

## Logging In to Your Company Email

The first thing that needs to be done to get your device fully set up with your company is to log in to your company email. This will give you access to your granted apps along with the ability to use SSO (Single Sign On) when accessing said apps.

### Steps

1. Go to [office.com](https://office.com) and click Sign In
2. Type your company email in the email field
3. Enter your temporary password
4. You will be prompted to change your password - change it to something memorable but secure

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

After your first login, you will be prompted to set up additional security verification.

### Installing Microsoft Authenticator

1. Download **Microsoft Authenticator** from your device's app store
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)
2. Open the app and sign in with your company email

### Linking Your Account

1. When prompted on your computer, select "Next" to begin 2FA setup
2. Choose "Microsoft Authenticator app"
3. Open the Authenticator app on your phone
4. Tap the **+** icon and select "Work or school account"
5. Scan the QR code displayed on your computer screen
6. Approve the test notification sent to your phone

<Note>
Your company needs this additional security to protect your account and company data.
