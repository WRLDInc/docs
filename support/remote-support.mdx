## Getting Local Admin Access

Some installations require administrator privileges. If you need help getting admin access:

1. Click the WRLD Help Button or chat bubble on [wrld.host](https://wrld.host) or [wrld.tech](https://wrld.tech)
2. Request local admin credentials or elevation assistance
3. Be sure to include any line-of-business (LOB) apps that need pre-whitelisting
