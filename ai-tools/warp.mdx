Warp is an AI-native terminal and agentic development environment. This guide shows how to configure Warp's AI agent (Oz) to help you write and maintain your Mintlify documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Warp installed ([warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev))
- Access to your documentation repository

## Agent skills

Warp uses **Agent Skills** — markdown files that teach Oz about your project conventions. Skills live in `.agents/skills/` directories and are automatically discovered.

### Create a docs-update skill

Create `.agents/skills/docs-update/SKILL.md` in your documentation repository:

````markdown
---
name: docs-update
description: Maintain and update Mintlify documentation
---

# Documentation Update Skill

## Project context
- This is a Mintlify documentation site
- Content is in MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Navigation is configured in `docs.json`

## Writing standards
- Use second person ("you") for instructions
- Write in active voice and present tense
- Start procedures with prerequisites
- Include expected outcomes for major steps
- Match the tone and style of existing pages

## Required page structure

Every page must start with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, specific title"
description: "Concise description for SEO and navigation"
---
```

## Mintlify components
- `<Note>`, `<Warning>`, `<Tip>`, `<Info>`, `<Check>` for callouts
- `<Steps>` and `<Step>` for sequential procedures
- `<Tabs>` and `<Tab>` for platform-specific content
- `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language code examples
- `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` for navigation cards
- `<Accordion>` for collapsible content
- Wrap images in `<Frame>` with descriptive alt text
````

### Create a WARP.md project file

Add a `WARP.md` file at the root of your documentation repository to provide project-level context:

````markdown
# WARP.md

## Project Overview
This is a Mintlify documentation site. Content is written in MDX format and configured via `docs.json`.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install Mintlify CLI
npm i -g mint

# Run local dev server
mint dev
```

## Architecture
- `docs.json` - Main site configuration
- Content pages use `.mdx` format with YAML frontmatter
- `snippets/` - Reusable MDX content blocks
- `images/` - Documentation images
````

## Using skills across projects

Place skills in `~/.agents/skills/` to make them available in all your repositories. Project-level skills in `.agents/skills/` take precedence for that project.
